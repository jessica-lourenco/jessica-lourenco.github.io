                    <p class="lead mb-5">Hello and welcome! I am a recent Montclair State University graduate. I received a Masters in Science in Computer Science in May 2021!
                       I am currently looking for full time opportunities to apply the skills and knowledge I've developed from school, jobs and internships.
                       My website gives some insight on my education, work experience and a few projects I've worked on.
                       The areas I'm most interested in are Web Development/Web Content, Artificial Intelligence and Information Management/Data Analytics!
                       I'm hoping to land in a position where I can use my creative and technical skills to improve and/or facilitate people’s lives through the use of technology.

                          The features in this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
                          Below are the basic statistical details of the characteristcs I chose to use and the heap map. </li>

                        <li>I programmed a decision tree model to classify if a tumor is malignant or benign. After training and testing the model, the training accuracy was 1 and the testing accuracy was 0.97. Below is the python code to the decision tree model.</li>

                        <li>I also built a web app using Flask framework where users can input values and the model will classify the diagnosis.

                    <ul>
                        <li>I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a sequential model in Keras to classify images of US Dollars and images of Indian Rupees.</li>
                        <li>The dataset consisted of labeled data of 48 images of real currency notes taken in various viewpoints and some images rotated in order to better train the model to recognize and classify the currency notes. The images of the US Dollars were taken by me and the images of the Indian Rupees were taken from a Kaggle Dataset - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shobhit18th/indian-currency-notes"> Indian currency notes.</a></li>
                        <li>To prepare the data, each image was resized to 140 x 140 pixels in order for the images to have the same shape and converted to a gray-scale image format like the one below. The training data was created by iterating through each image of US Dollars and Indian Rupees, adjusting the size of images and adding the classification of 0 for US Dollar and 1 for Indian Rupee.</li>

                        <li>The sequential model included:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Two convolution layers with Conv2D parameters including a learning of a total of 256 filters, a window of 3x3, and the input shape. The layers also include ReLU activation and max pooling of size 2 x 2.</li>
                            <li>A flattening layer that transforms a 2D feature map to a 1D vector.</li>
                            <li>Dense convolution layers where the first one consists of 64 nodes and ReLU activation and the second one of 1 node with final activation as sigmoid to be able to predict the probability as an output of 0 and 1.</li>

                          <li>After training the model with a batch size of 32, 12 epochs and a validation split of .10, the model returned an accuracy of 95% and a validation accuracy of 80% as can be seen below.</li>

                          <li>To test the model, I imported the saved model into a new file and used those two new images to test the prediction. Before feeding the images to the model, the images were prepared by resizing, reshaping, and applying a gray-scale like in the training data.
                          <li>The model then correctly identifies a US Dollar and an Indian Rupee as can be seen below.</li>

                <p> Other than my love for technology, I love to dance! I have been dancing from the age of 5 through college in styles like ballet, tap, jazz and lyrical. Although I no longer perform, I have been teaching kids for 5 years!</p>
                <p>I'm also a lover of warm weather, going to the beach, rivers and lakes, bike riding, watching sunsets and spending time in the mountains.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I absolutely love to travel and learn about other cultures. So far I've been to a few US states, Canada, Portugal, Spain, Mexico and Dominican Republic. Hopefully I can add on to that list in the near future.</p>
